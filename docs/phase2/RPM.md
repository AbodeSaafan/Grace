### Release 1 Planning Meeting
---
##### March 2nd 2017 | 10:20 AM - 10:50 AM
***

1. Our product owner was chosen to be Shayan Ghazi. First, the product owner discussed the purpose of the project. Then, he gave a description of his vision of the final form of the project. The team shared the product owner's enthusiasm and was sympathetic to his thinking.
2. Release Name and Theme: Basic Structure 1.0
	This release will focus on laying down the groundwork for the basic structure of the site- such as the account management for creating/logging into accounts- as well as testing out the technology for our project. The technology we will test is the compiler. This will be done by attempting to create the compiler's basic view and functionality. 
3. We have reviewed the definition of Done and have made no changes thus far; we anticipate making changes as we further progress the project. 
4. No features from backlog items were considered for scheduling into this release as we are beginning the project and need the basic structure to be working first. 
5. Stories that are involved in the first release were discussed to gain a common understanding of the goal; this discussion was led by the product owner. 
6. The team communicated clearly and efficiently, and encountered no problems in the meeting. Popular vote is still used to resolve decision making problems. The team discussed availability and coordinated times to dedicate to the project.
