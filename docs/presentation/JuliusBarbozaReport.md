# What is your most significant individual contribution?

My most significant contribution was implementing the user management API and file sharing API. On the API side, I implemented restful and issued calls to the database so that user and file (for file sharing) information were correctly recorded. I also worked with services such as Authorize Service and File Service, so that the services would make appropriate calls to the API.

# Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

Through this assignment I learnt various web based technologies such as Mongo, Express, Angular2, NodeJS (MEAN stack). These MEAN stack was challenging to setup and utilize as no one on the team had prior experience with MEAN stack. However MEAN stack allowed for a well-structured project thus allowing us to make tasks management simple and convenient.

# What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

My main strength would definitely be my ability to follow instructions, and to pinpoint and fix bugs quickly. It is essential for a team to follow the vision for the product, as such my ability to follow instructions and to communicate is vital for ensuring the product vision is met. Finally, my ability to pinpoint and fix bug quickly is essential as it allows for the project to progress with little to no issues.

# What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

My main weakness was adapting to the new technology (MEAN stack) used in this assignment. As a result tasks were taking longer to complete thus preventing the team from moving forward. However, as the project progressed this became less of an issue.
