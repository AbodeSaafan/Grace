 ### Most significant individual contribution
 ___
 My most significant individual contribution would have to be getting the file sharing system working. This included setting up the API side to handle the calls needed, handling database interaction and then creating the service that the front end uses. I also designed the front end so overall it was the section I worked the most on.
 
 ### Technical concept/issue learned while working on the project
 ___
 Heavy web development was pretty new to me since all I have done before is small websites with HTML/CSS/PHP and some JS, so using technology like MEAN stack and setting up that environment as well as setting up the localhost aspect to test it was new. Watching many YouTube videos is how I usually self-learn and I applied the same concept to learn what I needed to know. I now feel very comfortable using MEAN stack. 
 
 ### Main strength(s) as a team member
 ___
 I would consider one of my main strengths to be motivating team members to continuously work on improving the application and finishing each story or task to the fullest of our ability. I also find that debugging was another strength I had. The ability to quickly find broken code is crucial especially when the bug happens a few minutes before the tutorial demo. 
 
 ### Main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
 ___
 I find that my main weakness would be splitting up stories into tasks and assigning the tasks out. I find that I have a hard time "letting go" of a task to another team member mainly to the fear or being disconnected with what is happening with that story/aspect of the application.
