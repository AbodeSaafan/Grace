 ### Most significant individual contribution
 ___
 My most significant individual contribution would be getting the compiler and header components working. With sufficient support for them to be customizable and usable with other components. 
 
 ### Technical concept/issue learned while working on the project
 ___
All the technologies involved with MEAN stack were completely foreign to me at the start of the project. I first learned how to setup my environment. Afterwards, I gradually became more and more comfortable with Angular (my main focus) and familiarized with the other aspects as well. Importing, configuring and using modules was also another thing that I learned.
 
 ### Main strength(s) as a team member
 ___
As a team member I believe my main strength was just continuous work on the application as well as trying to start discussions and prompting for meetings.

 ### Main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
 ___
I believe my main weakness as a team member was my slow acknowledgement of my team-mates ideas. I would eventually come around, but it took me some time and effort spent in vain to do so.
