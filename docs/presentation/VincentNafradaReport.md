### Most significant individual contribution
___
My most significant contribution was the implementation of the front-end aspects of login and register components and as well as the formatting of landing and sidebar (user settings). I dealt with a lot of styling and setting up the front-end of these components for my team members that handled the back-end. 

### Technical concept/issue learned while working on the project
___
One concept that I learned was the use of MEAN stack. Although it was rather difficult to get setup by my teammates, the convenience it allows by having a components, services, and routing yields for a more organized project. In addition a technical concept I learned was the implementation of material design and the use of jquery. For material design, it has various html elements that make the site look more appealing. And that jquery provides a wide range of functionality that can make styling/navigation easier. 

### Main strength(s) as a team member
___
As a team member, my ability to communicate with other members is one of my strengths. Whether it's to reach out for help when needed and vice versa, or being honest with the progress of my task, I am sure to tell the team so there is no confusion or assumptions. In terms of technical strengths, I am very familiar with front-end development of web programming. 

### Main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
___
My main weakness is the inability to keep up with some of the tasks. For instance, the registration component and a sidebar component was somewhat behind schedule. Although I finished it, other team members may have been ready to merge their code with mine. In terms of technical weaknesses, my knowledge with some of the technologies we used were lacking. I did not have a lot of hands-on experience with back-end development and it showed with the lack of contribution for that aspect.
