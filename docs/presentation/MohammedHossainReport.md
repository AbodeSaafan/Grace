## Most Significant Individual Contribution

In terms of coding contribution, my most significant individual contribution would be to the authorization service, which I created and  developed [with Julius] from beginning to end. This service allowed for the bulk of validation, creation of tokens, and API interfacing [my second biggest coding contribution]. 

## New Technical Concept

Web development isn't one of my bigger strengths or areas of familiarity. As such interfacing with AngularJS and MongoDB for MEAN really forced me to learn strategies which I hadn't considered before. Even barring the specific technology, the implementation of all these parts to create such a large website is the overarching skill I learned from this project, and I feel confident about my web development prospects going forward.

## Main Strengths as a Team Member

My main strength as a team member was my persistent presence in group coding sessions and ability to organize pair programming, which led to some of the team's greatest moments of productivity. Furthermore my writing skills also strengthened the team, as it led to easy document production and scribing. 

## Main Weaknesses as a Team Member

My greatest weakness would likely be my availability for individual coding sessions. As I took a Math course, and was often busy with non-CSC301 work at home, I wasn't as strong of a presence as I wanted to be on the individual coding front.
