## Most Significant Individual Contribution

In terms of coding contribution, my most significant individual contribution would likely be to the authorization service, which I created and helped Julius develop from beginning to end. This service allowed for the bulk of validation, creation of tokens, and API interfacing [my second biggest coding contribution].
In terms of reducing workload for my peers, the answer would most likely be design documents and reporting- as I functioned as the scribe for the group.

## New Technical Concept

Web development isn't one of my bigger strengths or areas of familiarity. As such interfacing with AngularJS and MongoDB for MEAN really forced me to learn strategies which I hadn't considered before. Even barring the specific technology, the implementation of all these parts to create such a large website is the overarching skill I learned from this project, and I feel confident about my web development prospects going forward.

## Main Strengths as a Team Member

I think my greatest strengths are my writing skills- which led me to function as the group's scribe- and my persistent contribution to the front-end/back-end interfacing with API and Authorization. Julius and I also popularized pair programming within our group, which was a crucial aspect of development and as such were one of the biggest team strengths we were responsible for.

## Main Weaknesses as a Team Member

My greatest weakness would likely be my availability for individual coding sessions. As I was taking a unique courseload from my team mates (with a Math course) and had some issues to deal with at home, I wasn't as strong of a presence as I wanted to be on the individual coding front.
