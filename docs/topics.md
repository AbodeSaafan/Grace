# Our Topic

We are going to be creating an online __REPL__ (*read-eval-print-loop*) which can be consider as a primitive __IDE__.
We will be using the MEAN stack and the REPL is initially intended only for Python, but if time allows we will add
more languages and features.

### Necessary Features:
- Python langauge
- Shell run
- Shell clear
- Project saving/loading

### Potential Features:
- Syntax Highlighting
- More langauges
- File sharing
- Multiple editors
- Chat (between shared members)
- Permissions
- Dark theme
- Other UI options
