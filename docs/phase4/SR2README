The original variant of Sprint Retrospective 2 can be found under the phase3 folder, as initially we believed it should have been structured that way to accomodate for SR3 (as otherwise it has no space).

The SR2.md here is identical to the one under phase3, with the exception of a little note written at the top of the document directing you to this very file/explanation. It has only been placed here to match with the organizational standard mentioned in the marking scheme, and was submitted before the due date (check the timestamp on the version under phase3).
