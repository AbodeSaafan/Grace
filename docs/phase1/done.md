## Acceptance Criteria

1)  Given a simple web application when I navigate through the site then the experience should be seamless and the interface is easy to 
use.

2)  Given a large scale project when I save files/projects then I am able to preserve the code for future use.

3)  Given a new project to work on when I needed to revisit some old files for reuse then the file management system should become a very 
useful tool.

4)  Given a project/files that cannot be edited with Grace REPL, so I need to edit offline when I export the files then the same 
project/file should be preserved and in proper format to be worked on.

5)  Given a new file to be worked on when I want to import a file to my account then I should be able to edit it on GraceREPL.

6)  Given a file to be compiled when I compile and run the program then it should run uniformly as any other Python IDE should run.

7)  Given a requirement to quickly edit/run code when I edit/import a python file then I can edit and/or run it without having an account.

8)  Given a Python file to revise when I diagnose errors in the code then errors and warnings should be shown.

9)  Given the need to experiment code when I process commands in a shell then the code should do the computation.

10) Given a project base when I save a file and want to share it with other users then they can access it.

11) Given a set of files in my account when I manage the files and control the accessibility to them then users should not be permitted to
access files that were not shared.

12) Given a file being worked on when I edit the code and use keyboard shortcuts then I should navigate through the text seamlessly.

13) Given a group project when I want to contribute to the group work then I can access and edit files.

14) Given an account with all my files when I want to change the settings and/or login details then I can do so and preserve all my files 
along with their sharing properties.

15) Given a default user interface to work on when I want to customize the interface to suit my preference then I can change it and save 
the settings.
